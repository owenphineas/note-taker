# Note Taker

## Description
A webpage that saves notes written by users. The page allows users to enter a note with a title and body and save it. The page will also display a list of saved notes which can be viewed by clicking on them. The webpage exists to function as something like a digital notebook where users can make lists or take notes on any topic and revisit them later without having to use physical pen and paper. As a developer, creating this application has been good practice in writing API routes and using databases.

## Installation
The application is a deployed webpage located at https://note-taker-owenphineas-d6ca399f0323.herokuapp.com. It requires no other installation.

## Usage
To use the application, press the 'Get Started' button on the website's landing page. You will then be taken to the notes page. In order to save a new note, enter a title and body in the respective fields on the right side of the page. The fields can be cleared by clicking the 'Clear Form' button. Once the title and body are populated with text, the note can be saved by clicking the 'Save Note' button. Once a note is saved, it will appear on the list on the left side of the page. Previous notes can be accessed and edited by clicking on them.
